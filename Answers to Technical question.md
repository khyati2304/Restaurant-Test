# Task - 2: Answers to Technical questions 
Technical questions
1.	How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

    It took more time for me to execute the technical test. It was interesting and challenging for me, since I do not have much familiarity with the automation testing, it took a bit more time to understand concepts and write down step definitions as mentioned in the task. If I could have more time, there could be more essential test scenarios added in the list to deliver website quality. The scenarios such as Login, Search for dish, Search for popular cuisine etc. could have added. Apart from testing perspective, even step definitions could be maintained effectively by commenting or creating folders when required for modularity.

2.	What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

    I feel Continuous testing, or the amalgam of DevOps and testing is an interesting trend. As the functionality of projects is getting complex, the need of such testing is required to test at early phase and identify unexpected behavior. Also, the use of tools like Selenium and Robot Framework are interesting to test the applications catering quality of the product.

3.	How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?

    I would start with playing around and analyzing the application to understand its functionality or requirements. Once it is analyzed, I would plan whether to go with automated testing or manual testing. Since it is a legacy application, there would not be any updates in the application which opens the probability of performing automation testing on it. Secondly, there could be chance of having inconsistent environment. Therefore, in such situation, the manual testing adoption would cater better results.
    Yes, I had a situation where the platform on which application was built is demising and application is being migrated. The old application did not support all the browsers and was inconsistent due to its complex functionality. Moreover, it does not have any proper documentation or business logic. Thus, manual testing approach was selected due to lack of documentation, need for usability testing, and Ad-hoc testing.

4.	How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?

    According to me, the following modification should be made on following to improve customer experience:
    1.	The postal code once set up, does not disappear even after refresh. The customer needs to remove and then add new postal code.
    2.	The location should be shown on map as per the postal code added by customer 
    3.	There should be search by dish as well with postal code
    4.	The discounts should be added to the cart if any
    5.	Creating account with phone number would reduce the requirement to login the email account and also would remove the duplicates account
    6.	Pictures of food, menu, or place could be added in the restaurant details page for creating clear picture in mind for food and place

5.	Please describe yourself using JSON.

    JSON is used in transmitting data between servers and application. I have used JSON at novice stage in a web application for transmitting data. It is easy to read and interpret the structured data like XML.
